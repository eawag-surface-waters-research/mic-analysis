                In dimictic lakes, thermal bars (black line) typically form
                during spring and autumn mixing phases when waters on either
                side of the Tmd mix. In temperate lakes the Tmd is ~4 Â°C and
                vertical mixing is induced by water-column instability when
                surface water reaches this threshold.

              <p>
                Winter mixing anomalies refer to temporary shifts toward
                monomictic-like behavior, years in which a dimictic lake behaves
                as if it were monomictic. Over the past two decades, such
                anomalies have become increasingly common.

                This is a baseline for assessing whether current thermal
                behavior falls within the expected range or signals a departure
                indicative of an emerging shift.
